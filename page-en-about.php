              <h2>About "My Philosophy"</h2>
              <p>The interview series "My Philosophy," led by editor-in-chief DK Sugiyama, is an information site where he meets and converses with individuals he wishes to learn from, sharing their life stories, worldviews, and principles with readers. It began in 2007 when a freshly entrepreneurial Sugiyama planned it as web content to expand his business network.</p>
              <p>
                The origin dates back to 1994, when a 14-year-old Sugiyama conducted an interview with Mr. Sadaharu Oh, the current Chairman of the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, for a magazine feature.<br>
                "I want to listen to more people's stories and use them as nourishment for myself."<br>
                This valuable experience was the seed that grew into "My Philosophy."
              </p>
              <p>

                  loading="lazy"
                  decoding="async"
                />
              </p>
              <p>To date, "My Philosophy" has featured a diverse array of individuals, including top executives of major corporations, entrepreneurs, doctors, athletes, and artists, marking its 100th milestone interview in December 2022.</p>
              <p>
                The interviews reveal a spectrum of perspectives, with some guests suggesting that "a manager should not create enemies," while others assert that "a manager should be a beast who defeats their enemies," reflecting the varied backgrounds and values of the participants.<br>
                Yet, within their different life stories, there are three 'traits' and six 'forces' that are consistently shared.
              </p>
              <h3>Three "Traits"</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Energetic Adults</strong><br>
                  They welcome challenges and are lively enough to act proactively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Playful Spirit</strong><br>
                  They value both work and leisure, enjoying life, which they see as happening only once.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Broadened Perspectives through Travel</strong><br>
                  They venture to places of interest, both domestically and internationally, to see, feel, and absorb experiences firsthand.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Six "Forces"</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Vitality</strong><br>
                  Both mental and physical health are essential for work and enjoying personal life.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Initiative</strong><br>
                  The drive to "first try and then see," initiating action.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Course-Correcting Ability</strong><br>
                  When facing obstacles, they consult with others, think, and adjust their course, seeing barriers not as difficulties but as opportunities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Learning Ability</strong><br>
                  They maintain a mindset of learning from failures and applying lessons learned; when in doubt, they seek guidance from those who know.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Habitual Force</strong><br>
                  They consciously repeat desired behaviors until they become second nature.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Adaptability</strong><br>
                  They eagerly adopt new methods and knowledge, committed to continual growth regardless of age.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>For those struggling at work, lacking the courage to act, or unable to envision the future— in today's increasingly diverse world, the answer cannot be found in just one successful person's story.</p>
              <p>Listen to various people, find what resonates, and make it your own. If readers of "My Philosophy" can find encouragement to move forward, even just a little, it would be a joy. May the variety of passionate philosophies reach and resonate with many.</p>
